# AI code for DebtsTracker.io (Alexa, Wit.ai, Api.ai, Siri, etc.)

This is a public repository for AI behind [DebtsTracker.io](https://debtstracker.io/) bots in different messengers.

At the moment we have just 1:
* [Alexa skill](alexa-skill-code.json)

But we are going to play with:
* [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai) for [our bot](http://m.me/DebtsTracker) in Facebook Messenger
* [Api.ai](https://api.ai/) for [our Telegram bot](https://t.me/DebtsTrackerBot).

Please open an issue if you would like to help with this.
